# Governance-as-a-Service (GaaS) System Documentation

## Overview

The Governance-as-a-Service (GaaS) system is a comprehensive framework for managing compliance and policy enforcement in multi-agent AI systems. This documentation provides complete information about the system architecture, API endpoints, installation procedures, and usage guidelines.

## System Components

The GaaS system consists of three main components:

- **Backend System**: FastAPI-based REST API with governance logic
- **Client Simulation**: Multi-agent simulation framework for testing
- **Evaluation Framework**: Performance analysis and visualization tools

## Documentation Structure

## API Endpoints

The GaaS system provides five core REST API endpoints:

- `POST /register_agent` - Register new agents
- `POST /submit_action_log` - Submit agent actions for compliance checking
- `GET /enforcement_decision` - Get enforcement decisions for proposed actions
- `POST /upload_policy` - Upload and manage governance policies
- `GET /compliance_report` - Generate compliance reports

## Agent Types

The system supports four distinct agent behavioral patterns:

1. **Compliant Agent** - Always follows policies and enforcement decisions
2. **Non-Compliant Agent** - Frequently violates policies (70% ignore rate)
3. **Mixed Behavior Agent** - Variable compliance (30-80% compliance rate)
4. **Adaptive Learning Agent** - Learns from enforcement decisions over time

## Visualization Capabilities

The evaluation framework provides 12 comprehensive visualization types:

1. Response Time Distribution
2. Response Time Over Time
3. Compliance Rate by Agent Type
4. Enforcement Decision Breakdown
5. Actions Per Minute Over Time
6. Violation Count Distribution
7. Agent Performance Scatter Plot
8. Response Time by Endpoint
9. Compliance Rate Trends
10. System Load Analysis
11. Response Time Percentiles
12. System Activity Summary
